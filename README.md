Terminal based card game based on the real Rack-O card game.

The goal of the game is to order the 5 cards in your hand in 
ascending order. To replace a card in your hand, you must
either draw a card from the draw pile or pick the top card
off the discard pile. The card you replace will be placed at 
the top of the discard pile. The first person to have their
cards in ascending order wins.
